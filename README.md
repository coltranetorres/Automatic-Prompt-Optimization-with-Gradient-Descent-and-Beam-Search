### ProTeGi-Style Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) for Text-to-Video

This repo implements Automatic Prompt Optimization for text-to-video generation inspired by:

- Automatic Prompt Optimization with Gradient Descent and Beam Search (ProTeGi) — https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03495

It performs *textual “gradient descent”* over prompts using LLM feedback, explores with beam search, and exploits with a bandit selector.
